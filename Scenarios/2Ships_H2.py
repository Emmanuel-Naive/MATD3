Scenario: 2Ships_Head-on
2 ships are in the head-on rule

Definition for data in this scenario:
    ships_num: number of ships, int
    ships_init: initial positions of ships, array[x1,y1; x2, y2; ...]
    ships_goal: target positions of ships, array[x1,y1; x2, y2; ...]
    ships_speed(m/s): (constant) speeds of ships, array[v1; v2; ...]
    ships_head(degree): initial heading angles of ships, array[h1; h2; ...]
    (assume the spaces for all ships are same)
    ship_actions: action spaces of each ship, array[action1, action2, ...]
